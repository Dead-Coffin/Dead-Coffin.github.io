# Rules
These rules are here to keep everyone civil and prevent issues with people.

## Community Guidelines
**Be Mature**\
You are expected to be mature and control your behavior in a manner that adheres to basic human decency.

**No Inappropriate Speech**\
This includes racism, sexism, bullying, harassing, or otherwise being hurtful toward other people. We have a zero-tolerance policy for this sort of behavior.

**English Only in Discord Chat**\
The majority of our players, as well as the administrative staff utilize English as their native language.

**Keep Personal Disputes Out of The Server**\
Please keep any arguments/disputes out of the server, no one cares about your disputes with your friend.

**No Political/Religious Discussions**\
Please reframe from having any political or religious discussions in the discord. We find that such discussions usually cause disputes, and at the end of the day we're here to game not discuss such stuff.

**Don't Ping Members for No Reason**\
Try to avoid pinging members for trivial matters. AKA pinging someone out of the blue just to talk trash about them or for no reason is not allowed.

**Staff Have Final Say**\
If you disagree with a staff's decision then take it up with them privately, or talk to another staff member about it. These are the current staff ranks:\
```Root, Admin, Sub Admin, Moderators```

## In-game Rules
**No Cheating**\
We want the game to be fair for everyone, so any kind of cheating/hacking is prohibited.

**Don't Grief Others**\
This means taking any action in a base that cannot be justified as necessary to breach, loot, and exit a base, or to kill the inhabitants. This includes sealing off someone's tool cupboard when you're done raiding, destroying or clearing it is fine though.

**The Community Guide Lines Still Apply**\
While this should be obvious, but here it is anyways. The community guide line rules still apply even if you're in game. The punishment for breaking them may vary. For example if you break the rules in the game you'll be punished in game, but not in Discord and vice versa.

**Small Teams Only**\
We want to keep teams small to keep it fair for the smaller groups. It's entirely up to the staff discretion what size of team is against this rule and what isn't.  Meaning a team of like 16 people will not be allowed, while a team size of 4 or 5 will be.

**Admin Discretion**\
It's entirely up to the Admin for building assistance, or anything of that nature. Pestering them probably won't incline them to help you any sooner.

**Admin Integrity**\
No one likes cheaters especially from admins. That's why we only have a limited number of chosen full admins in the server, however humans aren't perfect, so if you believe someone is abusing their admin privileges please notify someone in ``Root`` or ping one of us in the Discord to get our attention if we have DMs disabled.
